# Alcovia — Offline-first Focus & Syllabus Sync

Take-home implementation for Alcovia's offline-first focus sessions, syllabus progress, multi-device sync, and n8n automation.

## Stack

- **Client:** React Native (Expo, web supported) + TypeScript + React Navigation + AsyncStorage
- **UI:** Custom screens with Google Fonts (Fraunces, DM Sans, JetBrains Mono), `react-native-svg`, `expo-linear-gradient`
- **Backend:** Express + TypeScript + JSON file store
- **Automation:** n8n workflow (`n8n-workflow.json`)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker (for n8n) or n8n Cloud
- Two browser contexts for multi-device demo (normal window + incognito, or two profiles)

## Quick start

### 1. Install (monorepo root)

```bash
npm install
```

Workspaces: `@alcovia/client` (`alcovia-client/`) and `@alcovia/backend` (`backend/`).

### 2. Run backend + client

**Both together:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Or separately:**

```bash
npm run dev:backend   # http://localhost:3001
npm run dev:client    # Expo web
```

Optional backend env:

```bash
PORT=3001
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5678/webhook/focus-success
```

**Reseed syllabus data** (11 subjects, 107 topics + device-a / device-b local snapshots):

```bash
npm run reseed
```

If the server is already running, also call `POST http://localhost:3001/dev/reset` or use **Reset server + local** in the client dev panel.

### 3. n8n workflow

1. Open n8n (Docker example):

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
```

2. Import `n8n-workflow.json` from the repo root.
3. Activate the workflow.
4. Confirm webhook path: `POST /webhook/focus-success`

The workflow dedupes on `sessionId` using workflow static data, then POSTs to the backend mock sink at `http://host.docker.internal:3001/dev/mock-whatsapp`.

### 4. Client (two devices)

With `npm run dev:client` or `npm run dev` running, open two separate browser contexts (tabs share storage):

- Window A → **dev** button → select `device-a`
- Window B (incognito) → **dev** button → select `device-b`

Both use hardcoded `studentId = student-1`.

After reseeding, refresh each device with **Reset server + local** → **Sync now**, or run:

```bash
npm run apply-device-seeds
```

## App overview

### Landing page

- Study quote on the left, **Focus** and **Syllabus** entry cards on the right
- Responsive layout with gradient background

### Focus

- Tap the plant to open a **round duration dial** (25–120 min), then start a session
- **Empty stems** appear when the session starts; **leaves attach** over time (no grow animation)
- Floating **✎** stats menu (bottom-right): streak, coins, today's minutes, recent sessions
  - Session list colors: green = completed, red = failed, blue = running
- Give up / dev-complete controls during an active session

### Syllabus

- **Book shelf** (3 books per row) — one book per subject
- Click a book to show its **topics panel** on the right (grouped by chapter)
- Tap a topic to cycle status; color updates:
  - Gray = not started
  - Blue = in progress
  - Green = done
- Selected book becomes **translucent** (no lift animation)

### Dev panel

- Small **dev** button next to the header title opens a **draggable** floating panel
- Online/offline toggle, device switch (`device-a` / `device-b`)
- Sync now, reset local, reset server + local
- Live state, pending mutations, sync log, n8n notifications

## Demo script (matches video checklist)

1. **Offline focus on both devices**
   - Set both offline in the dev panel.
   - Device A: open Focus → set duration → start → Dev-complete a session.
   - Device B: repeat with another session.
2. **Conflicting syllabus edit**
   - Device A offline: open Syllabus → select a book → tap a topic until **Done**.
   - Device B offline: tap the same topic to **In progress**.
3. **Reconnect**
   - Bring both online → **Sync now**.
   - Both devices show identical coins, streak, today minutes, task status, and session history.
4. **n8n idempotency**
   - Open dev panel → n8n notifications.
   - You should see **one notification per successful session**, even if replayed during sync.

## Features

### Focus sessions

- Duration: 25–120 minutes (circular dial + presets 25/45/60/90).
- Success: timer reaches target while staying in session.
- Fail: Give up, or app backgrounded > 5 seconds (`app_switch`).
- Rewards (offline optimistic, server authoritative): +50 coins, streak update, today's focus minutes.

### Syllabus progress

- 11 subjects (Mathematics, Science, History, English, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Biology, Economics, Geography, Art & Design).
- Subjects → chapters → tasks (107 seeded topics).
- Tap task to cycle: Not started → In progress → Done.
- Chapter % = done tasks / total tasks; subject % = average of chapter %.
- Delete (×) on each topic for tombstone/delete conflict testing.

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check |
| POST | `/sync/push` | Push mutation batch |
| GET | `/sync/pull` | Pull merged server state |
| GET | `/dev/notifications` | Mock notification log |
| POST | `/dev/mock-whatsapp` | n8n sink (deduped) |
| POST | `/dev/reset` | Reset server state |

## Conflict handling

| Case | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| Same task status conflict | Higher Lamport wins; tie → higher status rank (`done` > `in_progress` > `not_started`); tie → lexicographic `deviceId` |
| Task edited vs deleted | Tombstone delete wins if its Lamport ≥ competing update |
| Duplicate sync mutation | Ignored by mutation `id` |
| Same session replay | Session outcome applied once; rewards keyed by `sessionId` |
| n8n replay | Deduped in workflow static data + backend mock sink |

See `DECISIONS.md` for the full sync model.

## Assumptions / defaults

- Single student: `student-1`
- Coins: 50 per successful session
- App-switch grace: 5 seconds
- UTC calendar dates for streak/today totals
- Web demo uses per-device AsyncStorage namespaces (`alcovia:device-a:state`, `alcovia:device-b:state`)
